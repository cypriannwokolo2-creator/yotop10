# YoTop10 — Product Specification v0.1

> A futuristic, debate-first platform where facts and opinions collide through ranked lists, comparisons, and community verdicts.

---

## 1. Brand Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | YoTop10 *(may rebrand later — see Section 21 for name ideas)* |
| **Tagline** | *"Fact mine. Debate ground. Your list vs the world."* |
| **Positioning** | Medium × Reddit × Myspace — built for lists, facts & arguments |
| **Tone** | Passionate, controversial, credible, community-driven |
| **Audience** | Global. Anyone with a hot take backed by facts. |

---

## 2. Core Concept

YoTop10 is a **social publishing platform** centered on:
- **Top lists** (Top 10, Top 5, Top 25, etc.)
- **Debates** (This vs That, Who Is Better, Best Of)
- **Fact drops** (sourced opinion pieces disguised as ranked content)

The mission: **build the internet's best fact mine and debate ground** — where quality content gets argued, verified, and ranked by real people with real passion. No algorithm. No ads. No monetization pressure. Pure content.

---

## 3. Post / Content Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Top List** | Ranked items with written justification per item | "Top 10 Most Influential Scientists Ever" |
| **This vs That** | Two-item head-to-head comparison | "Kendrick vs Drake: Who Really Won?" |
| **Who Is Better** | Multi-candidate comparison | "Messi, Ronaldo, Pelé — Final Verdict" |
| **Fact Drop** | Short sourced statement or discovery | "5 facts about X that nobody talks about" |
| **Best Of [Period]** | Time-scoped curated lists | "Best Movies of 2024" |
| **Worst Of** | Inverse list (controversy magnet) | "Top 10 Most Overrated Albums" |
| **Hidden Gems** | Underrated/undiscovered topic lists | "10 Countries No One Talks About" |
| **Counter List** | A direct rival to an existing list | "My rebuttal to [Author]'s Top 10 Rappers" |

> All post types support images per item and optional source citations.

---

## 4. List Format Rules

- **Length**: Flexible (Top 5 to Top 25+), but default and preferred is **Top 10**
- **Items**: Each item requires a **title + written justification** (mandatory)
- **Sources**: Optional but strongly encouraged — a "sourced" badge is awarded
- **Images**: One image per item (optional). No videos. Clean reading experience.
- **Editing**: Authors have a **2-hour window** that starts at **review approval** to edit. After that, locked. ✅
- **Categories**: Every post must be tagged with at least one category (see Section 10)

---

## 5. User Roles & Tiers

### Anonymous User
- Created with: **name + password only** (no email required)
- Platform stores device cookies/fingerprint to prevent spam (disclosed in ToS)
- Can post, comment, vote, react, follow, connect

### Standard User (Email/Google)
- Created with: **Google OAuth** or **email + verify + password + name**
- All anonymous user capabilities + email digest + notification preferences

### Author ⭐
- Unlocked after **20 posts approved** by editorial review
- Benefits: Posts pushed higher in public feed, Author badge on profile, priority review queue

### Editor / Admin (internal)
- Reviews submitted posts for public feed qualification
- Can feature lists, manage communities, resolve reports

---

## 6. Feed System

> **Core principle: No algorithm. Chronological by default. No filter bubbles.**

### Timeline Feed Options (No Algorithm)
Users can choose what they see in their timeline:
- **Global**: All approved posts from all categories
- **Newest**: Chronologically sorted (newest first)
- **Random**: Randomly shuffled posts for discovery
- **Specific Category**: Posts filtered by selected category only

> **Note**: Users must select a category when creating a post (required), and users can filter their timeline by category.

### Public Feed (Homefeed)
- Shows all **editorially approved** posts based on user's timeline preference
- Anyone can see it, logged in or not
- Paginated, no infinite scroll rage-bait tricks

### Personal / Connection Feed
- Shows posts from **people you follow or are connected with**
- Includes posts that didn't pass editorial review (private-quality posts)
- Can be set to **private mode** (only YOU see your own posts, others can't see them unless approved)

### Arguments Page (Hot Takes / Debates)
- The most **controversial and debated** posts right now
- Separate page — doesn't pollute the main feed
- Ranked by debate activity (replies, counter-lists, per-item challenges)

### Rankings Page
- Leaderboard of top-performing lists
- Ranked by engagement, reactions, and community verdict
- Shows top lists across all categories or filtered by category

### Trending Page
- Posts gaining traction quickly
- Based on velocity of engagement (reactions, comments, views)
- Updated in real-time

### Weekly / Monthly Best Pages
- Editorial + community-voted best lists of the week/month
- Static pages updated on schedule

### List of the Year
- Annual community + editorial award for best list

---

## 7. Review & Moderation System

- All new posts enter a **review queue** before hitting the public feed
- **Authors** (20+ approved posts) get **priority review** — faster pipeline
- If a post is **not approved**, it still lands in the author's personal/connection feed
- Review criteria: Is it on-topic? Is it reasonably sourced? Is it quality writing?
- **Moderator at launch**: Founder solo. Community moderators can be appointed per-community as the platform scales.

### Strike System
- Users accumulate **strikes** for violations (spam, abuse, misinformation, etc.)
- Strikes are manually issued by admin/moderators
- **Default thresholds** (editable in admin dashboard):
  | Strikes | Consequence |
  |---|---|
  | 1 | Warning only — user notified |
  | 2 | 7-day account suspension |
  | 3 | Permanent ban |
- Admin can override thresholds for any individual user at any time

### Auto-Hide Rules (Suggested Standards)
Admin sets conditions from dashboard — all individually toggleable:

| Condition | Default Threshold | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Report threshold** | 5 reports within 2 hours | Most common trigger |
| **Keyword filter** | Configurable banned word list | Auto-hides on match |
| **Anonymous spam** | >3 posts in 30 minutes from same device | Anti-spam |
| **New user rapid posting** | >5 posts in 1 hour for accounts <7 days old | Reduces bot activity |
| **Engagement anomaly** | Mass reports from accounts created same day | Coordinated attack detection |

- All thresholds are editable from the admin dashboard
- Auto-hidden posts go into an **admin review queue** — not deleted
- Post stays visible to the author in their personal feed

---

## 8. Engagement & Reaction System

> **Not likes. Something that means something.**

### Reaction System (v1 — evolving)
- **MVP reaction**: 🔥 **Fire** (single reaction, clean and simple for launch)
- Will evolve post-launch into richer system as community grows
- Reactions apply to: posts, individual list items, and comments

> [!NOTE]
> The real engagement goal is driven by **structural actions** — replies, counter lists, per-item challenges, rival lists — not just reaction icons. Reactions are supplementary. The debate mechanics ARE the engagement system.

### Reaction system sits alongside:
- Replying to a comment
- Challenging a specific item (⚡ per-item debate thread)
- Publishing a Counter/Rival List
- Voting on the Community Version of a list
- Endorsing a position in a Battle View

### Voting System (Futuristic)
Not Reddit upvotes. Instead, a **"Verdict Meter"** system:
- Each post accumulates a **community verdict** based on reactions and engagement
- Verdicts: `CONFIRMED` / `CONTESTED` / `HOT TAKE` / `DEBUNKED` / `UNDECIDED`
- Displayed as a **animated meter/bar** on the post card — not a number
- High-engagement posts trigger a **"Jury's Out"** spotlight on the Hot Takes page

### Per-Item Challenges
- Any user can **challenge a specific ranked item** in a list
- Challenge opens a threaded debate anchored to that item
- The challenged item gets a ⚡ indicator on the list
- Author can optionally respond to defend their ranking

### Rival Lists / Counter Lists
- Any author can publish a **Counter List** directly linked to another list
- **No review process** — Counter Lists publish immediately
- On the original list page, the **original list is always prominently displayed** alongside any counter lists
- A **"Rivals" button** appears on any list that has been countered
- Clicking it shows all rival lists in Battle View

### Community Version
- Once a list reaches a high engagement threshold, a **"Community Version"** is auto-generated
- Readers can vote to reorder items — the community ranking sits alongside the author's original
- Shows: Author's ranking vs Community's ranking (side by side)

---

## 9. Comment System

- **Two comment modes** on any post:
  1. **Item Comment** — anchor your comment to a specific list item (item is highlighted, comment threads off it)
  2. **Full Post Comment** — comment on the list as a whole
- Comment threads support **nested replies** (max 3 levels to keep it readable)
- Comments support **reactions** too (🔥 Fire for now, evolving later)
- A comment can itself become a **mini-debate** if it gets enough engagement

---

## 10. Categories & Communities

### Categories (Post Tags — Broad)
Film & TV · Music · Sports · Science & Tech · History · Politics · Food & Drink · Travel · Gaming · Books & Literature · Pop Culture · Business · Environment · Philosophy · True Crime · Other

### Discussion Communities (Curated by Owner)
- Not Reddit-style open subreddits
- **Hand-picked** topics that work well as ongoing communities
- Owner (you) can expand the list over time
- Examples: `#FilmDebates` `#MusicCourt` `#SportsTribunal` `#ScienceFacts`
- Users can **post into** a community or just **follow** it

---

## 11. Author Profiles

- Every user has a **public profile page**
- Futuristic default style (matching site theme)
- **Custom theme option**: Users can write their own **HTML + CSS** to customize their profile (Spacehey-style)
  - Sandbox environment to prevent malicious code
  - Preview before applying
- Profile shows: Posts, Reactions received, Author tier, Badges, Communities followed

---

## 15. Language & Localization

---

## 16. Design System

## 20. Open Questions (Still Need Answers)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These decisions still need your input.

1. **Anonymous fingerprinting**: Device fingerprinting or lighter method (IP rate limiting)?
2. **Counter List approval**: Goes through review, or Authors post them directly?
3. **Auto-hide conditions**: What specific conditions trigger auto-hiding a post? (e.g., X reports in Y hours, specific keywords, unverified sources?)
4. **Strike thresholds**: How many strikes before warning / suspension / ban? (e.g., 1=warning, 2=7-day suspend, 3=permanent ban)
5. **Community reports**: How does the report system work inside communities? (Who sees it? What happens auto vs manual?)
6. **Timeline**: Passion project or launch deadline?

---

- Filter by: type (post / comment), community, severity, status
- Resolve reports: Dismiss / Warn User / Remove Content / Strike User
- Community moderators see only their community's reports and can act within their permissions

---

## 22. Ephemeral Thread System (Community Private Threads)

> The ONLY form of private interaction on the platform. Inspired by Discord threads + Snapchat burn timer.

### How It Works
1. Any user inside a community can **create a Private Thread**
2. They **tag/invite** one or more users by username
3. The thread is **visible only to participants**
4. Creator sets a **burn timer**:
   - Auto-expire: X minutes/hours **after the last recipient responds**
   - Auto-burn: Delete **before the recipient even sees it** (ephemeral drafts)
5. Once the timer hits, the thread and all messages are **permanently deleted** — no archive

### Key Rules
- Only works **inside a community** (not platform-wide)
- Cannot be screenshot-notified (best-effort, platform won't block screenshots but won't encourage them)
- Admin can appoint moderators via thread — the invite is the moderator nomination
- External moderator hire: Admin sends a 10-minute expiry **email invite link** to join the community and see the thread
- No media in threads for MVP (text only to start)

### Why This vs DMs
- Keeps the platform focused on **public debate**
- Prevents clique formation and backroom drama
- Burn timers reinforce the ethos: say what matters, then let it go
- Privacy by design — nothing persists

---
